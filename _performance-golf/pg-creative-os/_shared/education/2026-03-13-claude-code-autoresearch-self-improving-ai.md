## Executive Summary

Nick Saraev walks through how to adapt Andrej Karpathy's open-source "autoresearch" repo — originally built to autonomously experiment on ML model hyperparameters overnight — into a general-purpose self-improving optimization loop for sales and marketing. The core pattern: define a clear metric, give an AI agent API access to change inputs and read results, then run the loop on a cron (e.g., every hour via GitHub Actions). The agent generates a "challenger" variant, measures it against the baseline, logs learnings to a resource file, and compounds those learnings into each subsequent experiment.

The most actionable takeaway for PG: **any marketing asset with an objective metric and API access to both deploy changes and read results can be put on an autonomous optimization loop** — cold email copy (reply rate), landing pages (conversion rate), ad creatives (CTR/CVR), product descriptions (revenue), email subject lines (open rate), and more. The agent doesn't need to be smarter than a human optimizer — it just needs to run 24x/day while the human sleeps.

---

## Key Tactical Takeaways

1. **The Autoresearch Pattern**: Clone Karpathy's autoresearch repo as scaffolding. The core loop is: Hypothesis → Deploy Experiment (via API) → Measure Results → Pick Winner → Log Learnings → Generate New Challenger → Repeat.

2. **Three Requirements for Any Use Case**: (a) An objective metric you can track (reply rate, CVR, CTR, revenue), (b) API access to change the inputs (email copy, page content, ad creative), (c) API access to read the results (analytics endpoint, platform dashboard API).

3. **Orchestrator Architecture**: A top-level "orchestrator" agent manages sub-agents and tool calls. It calls the platform API (e.g., Instantly for cold email), deploys baseline + challenger campaigns, harvests results, and generates the next challenger based on cumulative learnings.

4. **Resource.md as Compound Knowledge**: Every experiment's learnings are logged to a `resource.md` file that grows over time. This file is fed into future experiment design, making each subsequent challenger more informed than the last. After ~500-1,000 runs, consolidate/compress to prevent context bloat.

5. **Challenger vs. Baseline Framework**: The system always maintains one "baseline" (current best) and tests one "challenger" against it. If the challenger wins, it becomes the new baseline. Most challengers lose initially — that's expected. The compounding effect comes from the few that win.

6. **Faster Loops = Faster Improvement**: Karpathy's ML loop ran every 5 minutes (12 experiments/hour). Nick's cold email loop runs every 4 hours (6/day). The tighter the feedback loop, the faster the optimization curve. Push toward the fastest loop your data volume supports.

7. **GitHub Actions for Autonomous Scheduling**: Deploy the orchestrator as a GitHub Actions cron job. Nick runs his every hour. The action triggers: Harvest (collect previous results) → Generate (create new challenger) → Deploy (launch campaigns + assign leads).

8. **Slack Webhook for Monitoring**: Set up a Slack notification via webhook for every new experiment deployment and harvest result. Critical for maintaining visibility into a fully autonomous system.

9. **Not Ideal For**: Slow feedback loops (days/weeks between data), fuzzy/subjective metrics (you'd need proxy metrics like scales), or platforms without API access (though Chrome DevTools MCP can be a workaround).

10. **Scale Over Precision**: The AI agent doesn't need to make better decisions than a human on any single iteration. It wins because it runs 24x/day with zero downtime, zero human involvement, and compounds learnings across hundreds of experiments.

## Scaling & Performance Intelligence
<!-- PRIMARY CONSUMER: Tess -->

### Scaling Tactics

- **Autonomous experimentation at scale**: Instead of manually A/B testing one variable at a time, deploy an AI agent that runs continuous challenger-vs-baseline experiments. Nick's cold email optimizer runs every 4 hours — 6 experiments/day, 42/week, 2,184/year with zero human involvement.
- **Volume unlocks the loop**: The optimization loop's speed is gated by how fast you can accumulate statistically meaningful data. More traffic/leads = tighter feedback loops = faster optimization curves.
- **Start with baseline you wrote**: The initial baseline should be human-written (your best current version). Early challengers will mostly lose. The agent gets smarter as `resource.md` accumulates winning patterns.
- **Consolidation at scale**: After 500-1,000 experiments, the learnings document needs to be compressed/consolidated to prevent context window bloat. Plan for this maintenance.

### Format & Platform Intelligence

- **Platform API requirements**: The pattern works with any platform that has a read/write API. Explicitly mentioned: Instantly (cold email), Facebook Ads API, Google Ads API, YouTube Data Analytics v3 API, Wix/WordPress/Webflow APIs.
- **Chrome DevTools MCP as fallback**: For platforms without APIs (e.g., Amazon FBA product listings), use Chrome DevTools MCP with a tightly scoped step list to make changes programmatically.
- **GitHub Actions as the scheduler**: Free/cheap cloud cron that triggers the orchestrator at set intervals. Alternatives mentioned: Modal, or any cloud compute provider.

### Testing Frameworks

- **The Autoresearch Loop** (adapted from Karpathy):
  1. Define `test.md` with: goal, metric, test method
  2. Agent reads cumulative `resource.md` (learnings from all prior experiments)
  3. Agent generates hypothesis for why a change will improve the metric
  4. Agent creates challenger variant via API
  5. Both baseline and challenger run simultaneously
  6. Agent harvests results via API after set interval
  7. Winner becomes new baseline; learnings appended to `resource.md`
  8. Loop repeats on cron schedule

- **Cold Email Specific Test Structure**:
  - Baseline: human-written email (known performer)
  - Challenger: AI-generated variant based on accumulated learnings
  - Metric: reply rate (positive reply rate ideal, total reply rate acceptable)
  - Cycle: every 4 hours (Nick's current setup, planning to tighten to hourly)
  - Leads: drawn from pre-existing pool/database, split between baseline and challenger

### Performance Benchmarks

- **Cold email reply rates observed**: 2.4%-2.5% as typical campaign rates shown on screen
- **Starting baseline**: ~1.5% reply rate (test 1)
- **After ~12 tests**: ~2.7% reply rate
- **Trajectory**: Approaches "optimal quality possible" for the given email list/audience over extended runs
- **Karpathy's ML results**: Validation BPB (bits-per-byte) dropped significantly after "just a few runs" of autonomous experimentation

---

## Creative & Copy Intelligence
<!-- PRIMARY CONSUMER: Neco -->

### Audience Language Bank

- **Pain quotes**: "There's just so much logistical overhead and friction involved in running any sort of experiment whether you're a marketer, a salesperson" — the pain of manual testing overhead
- **Desire quotes**: "You wake up in the morning to a log of experiments and hopefully a better model" — the dream of overnight autonomous improvement
- **Their words**: "self-improving," "auto-optimize," "zero human involvement," "runs on autopilot," "feedback loop," "challenger vs baseline"

### Hook Structures & Pattern Interrupts

- **Opening hook structure**: "An open source project just dropped that when you combine it with Claude Code literally becomes self-improving AI." — Pattern: [credibility anchor: open source + named tool] + [extraordinary claim] + immediate payoff framing.
- **Anti-hype qualifier**: "This is not engagement farming or hype bait" — immediately follows the bold claim, builds trust by acknowledging the audience's skepticism.
- **Authority transfer**: Karpathy's name and reputation are introduced within the first 30 seconds as the credibility anchor for the entire video.
- **"Here's one of many examples"**: Transitions from concept to proof by showing a real, running implementation with actual metrics on screen.

### Creative Frameworks

- **The Autoresearch Adaptation Framework** (for creative optimization):
  1. Identify the asset to optimize (email, page, ad, description)
  2. Define the objective metric (reply rate, CVR, CTR, revenue)
  3. Ensure API access for both deployment and measurement
  4. Write a strong human baseline
  5. Let AI generate challengers informed by cumulative learnings
  6. Run continuously, compound knowledge over time

- **Challenger Copy Generation Pattern** (from the cold email example):
  - AI reads all previous experiment learnings from `resource.md`
  - Generates a specific hypothesis: "The baseline is too long, buries the offer, lacks specific CTA time"
  - Creates challenger with targeted changes: sub-75 words, relevance-frontloaded, risk reversal upfront, concrete time ask
  - This mirrors the kind of structured creative brief Neco already generates — the difference is the feedback loop closes automatically

### Proof & Credibility Patterns

- **Named authority**: Karpathy positioned as "one of the foremost voices in AI and machine learning research"
- **Screen share proof**: Actual Instantly dashboard showing campaign reply rates (2.4%, 2.5%)
- **Live build**: Builds the system on camera, showing real code, real API calls, real Slack notifications
- **Specificity as proof**: Exact numbers (4-hour loops, 12 experiments/hour at 5-min intervals, 73% unsubscribed stat)
- **"I'm actually doing this"**: Repeatedly frames examples as things running in his own business, not hypotheticals

### Competitive Intelligence

- **Facebook and Google "already do this for you"**: Nick acknowledges platform-native optimization exists but argues it's "nowhere near as effective as you can with modern models like Opus 4.6 or GPT 5.4" — positioning AI-agent-driven optimization as superior to platform algorithms.
- **Democratization angle**: "The fact that we're able to democratize that and now do that for ourselves" — frames this as bringing big-lab methodology to individual businesses.

## Detailed Notes

### Karpathy's Original Autoresearch Concept

Andrej Karpathy released an open-source repo called "autoresearch." The original purpose: give an AI agent a small but real LLM training setup, let it experiment autonomously overnight. It modifies code, trains for 5 minutes, checks if results improved (validation loss), keeps or discards, and repeats. You wake up to a log of experiments and hopefully a better model.

### Nick's Adaptation: Cold Email Optimizer

Nick took the autoresearch pattern and applied it to cold email copy optimization:
- **Platform**: Instantly (cold email tool with full API)
- **Metric**: Reply rate
- **Variable**: Email copy (subject line + body)
- **Architecture**: Orchestrator agent at top level, sub-agents for copy generation, API client for Instantly, utility scripts for lead management
- **Loop frequency**: Every 4 hours (planning to tighten)
- **Notification**: Slack webhook pings for every deployment and harvest

Key files in his setup:
- `orchestrator.py` — Top-level agent prompt and logic
- `instantly_client` — API wrapper for Instantly platform
- `baseline` — Current best-performing email copy
- `resource.md` — Cumulative learnings from all experiments
- `config` — API tokens, campaign settings
- GitHub Actions workflow — Cron scheduling

### The Three-Step Harvest-Generate-Deploy Cycle

1. **Harvest**: Collect results from previous experiment via API. Compare baseline vs. challenger metrics.
2. **Generate**: Using cumulative learnings from `resource.md`, generate a new challenger with a specific hypothesis about what will improve the metric.
3. **Deploy**: Create new campaigns via API, assign leads from pool, activate both baseline and challenger.

### Specific Challenger Example Shown

- **Baseline subject**: "Quick question"
- **Baseline**: Longer email, offer buried mid-copy
- **Challenger hypothesis**: "Baseline is too long, buries the offer, lacks specific CTA time"
- **Challenger changes**: Sub-75 words, relevance frontloaded, risk reversal upfront ("zero risk on your end"), concrete time ask ("Is this worth a quick call?")
- **Challenger copy**: "Hey [first name]. My drive PPC leads for a 2 mill a year dental marketing firm in Calgary. I've sold over 10 million business agencies like yours through cold outbound alone. Got a backlog of people wanting PPC right now variety of verticals. I'd send you booked appointments and only charge if we hit a number you and I agree on beforehand. Zero risk on your end. Is this worth a quick call?"

### Use Cases Enumerated

| Use Case | Metric | API/Method |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Cold email copy | Reply rate | Instantly API |
| Landing pages (CRO) | Conversion rate | Wix/WordPress/Webflow API |
| Ad creatives | CVR/CTR | Facebook/Google Ads API |
| Chatbot scripts | Customer satisfaction score | Custom metric + template API |
| E-commerce product descriptions | Revenue/sales | Chrome DevTools MCP (Amazon FBA) |
| YouTube titles | CTR/views | YouTube Data Analytics v3 API |
| Newsletter subject lines | Open rate | Email platform API |
| Pricing pages | Conversion rate | Website builder API |
| SEO pages | Rankings/traffic | CMS API + analytics |

### What Doesn't Work Well

Three disqualifiers:
1. **Slow feedback loops**: If it takes days/weeks to get meaningful data, the optimization curve is too flat. Faster loops (minutes/hours) dramatically outperform slower ones.
2. **Fuzzy metrics**: "Warmth" or "happiness" can't be directly measured. You'd need proxy metrics (scales, NPS scores), which adds noise.
3. **No API access**: Without programmatic access to change inputs, the agent can only suggest changes for manual implementation — defeating the purpose.

### Technical Setup Notes

- Clone the Karpathy autoresearch repo for scaffolding
- Use Claude Code (or any IDE with Claude integration) to adapt it
- API keys needed: Anthropic (for Claude Opus 4.6 orchestrator), platform API (e.g., Instantly), GitHub (for Actions deployment)
- Karpathy himself noted his prompt "is probably pretty crappy and that it'd be very easy to make a better one"
- Nick used WhisperFlow (voice dictation) to describe what he wanted Claude Code to build

## Application Notes

### For Tess (Scaling)
- **Direct application — Ad creative optimization loop**: PG could build an autoresearch-style loop for Facebook/Meta ad creatives. Metric: CTR or purchase CVR. Variable: hook copy, headline, body text. API: Meta Marketing API. This would compound creative learnings autonomously across hundreds of hook variants.
- **Landing page CRO automation**: Sales pages and VSL pages could be A/B tested autonomously with conversion rate as the metric, especially high-traffic pages where data accumulates quickly.
- **Hook stack expansion**: The challenger-vs-baseline pattern maps directly to Tess's hook testing framework. Instead of manual batch creation, an autonomous loop could generate and test hook variants at scale.

### For Neco (Copy)
- **Self-improving copy knowledge base**: The `resource.md` concept — cumulative learnings from what copy patterns win — is essentially an auto-generating swipe file of proven patterns. This could feed directly into Neco's Context Gatherer with empirically validated audience language and hook structures.
- **Cold email adaptation for PG**: While PG doesn't do cold email, the same pattern applies to email subject lines, ad hooks, and checkout copy. Any copy element with a clear metric and fast feedback loop is a candidate.
- **Challenger hypothesis generation**: The way the AI generates a specific hypothesis before creating a challenger ("too long, buries the offer, lacks specific CTA") mirrors Neco's brief structure. The difference is the hypothesis gets validated by real data, not just creative judgment.

An open source project just dropped that
when you combine it with claude code
literally becomes self-improving AI.
This is not engagement farming or hype
bait. This is a real repo that was just
released by Andre Karpathy who is widely
renowned as one of the foremost voices
in AI and machine learning research. And
basically what he did was while training
his model he thought why don't I just
have my models train my models instead.
He built an elegant pipeline which he's
calling auto research and essentially
completely and fully automates the
process of experimentation. He says it
right here. The idea is to give an AI
agent a small but real LLM training
setup and just let it experiment
autonomously overnight. It'll modify the
code, train for 5 minutes, check if the
results improved, keep or discard, and
then just repeat. You wake up in the
morning to a log of experiments and
hopefully a better model. Now, I'm not
in machine learning training. I don't
help make models more intelligent. What
I do is I take models that other people
have made and then I use them for the
purposes of making money. And so
immediately when this dropped, I started
thinking about ways that I could apply
this principle of auto research into my
own life to improve obviously my own
economic outcomes. And there are so many
it's not even funny. So what I'm going
to do is I'm going to run through some
real practical examples in a moment,
things that I'm actually doing in my own
business that you can implement inside
of Cloud Code. Then I'm going to show
you how to actually do it. So go through
the step by step of setting up the repo
and building some experimentation done
totally autonomously for you. And at the
end you will have a fully automated
self-improving pipeline just like Andre
Krypathy here has done for his own
machine learning training. So here's one
of many examples. I do a lot of cold
email in my own business and then for
clients. And cold email in case you
didn't know is where you package up a
really nice sexy sounding offer and then
you send it to people you've never met
with the hopes that they take you up on
it and then maybe convert. So jump on a
call with you, fill out a form,
whatever. Now the key metric in cold
email is usually reply rate.
specifically positive reply rate, but
reply rate's easier for our purposes, so
that's what I'm going to go with. And as
you can see, most cold email software
tracks this for you out of the box. So
2.4% of people replied to this campaign.
2.5% of people replied to this campaign
and so on. Well, turns out that's all
you need in order to build an automatic
experimentation pipeline. You need some
metric that you want to improve and then
you need some way factor, some thing you
can modify to improve it. And so what I
have is my metric is reply, right? And
then what I have is the thing that I can
adjust is my cold email copy. So what
this looks like in practice for me is a
folder called email optimizer. There are
a bunch of additional code files here,
configs, places where I'm storing the
results of my data and so on and so
forth that aren't super important. What
is important is this file right over
here called orchestrator.py.
And this contains all of the prompt that
I'm feeding into my orchestrator agent
who essentially is responsible for
spinning up new cold email campaigns and
then testing them against each other
until I get better and better results.
And it was as simple for me as literally
copying the repo and making some slight
adjustments. What I do is I tell it that
it's inspired by Carpathy's auto
research pattern. The core idea is an AI
agent that runs experiments autonomously
in a tight loop using an objective
metric as a feedback signal. I have the
architecture over here. I run the loop
every 4 hours and at the end of every 4
hours I actually have better copy that's
self-evolving over time based on the
results from my previous test. And you
can see some of the examples right over
here. Anything with C is what we call a
challenger. Anything with B is what's
called baseline. And so the model starts
with a baseline type of copy, which we
could see right over here. And then it
makes slight modifications based off of
what it knows to perform really well in
cold email copy before testing it out.
It runs the two side by side and then
automatically harvests based off of the
results, aka the number of replies and
so on and so forth for both campaigns.
Now, that part isn't the important bit.
I mean, we've been optimizing cold
emails for for many years at this point.
The important bit is it then creates new
copy based off of the learnings from
previous experiments. As the models get
better and better and better, they log
all of their learnings to a resource.m
MD that significantly improves future
models abilities to make changes. And so
here's a big list of things that this is
essentially figured out. Move reply rate
up. And so in that way, we get to push
towards that direction over time. Now,
this has only been running for a few
days now. Imagine this running for a
year. And instead of optimizing on a
basis of once every 4 hours, imagine if
this optimized on a basis of once every
5 minutes. Well, that's what my next leg
of testing is going to do. We're going
to be significantly improving the
volume, pumping all this stuff out at
10x the level, and then optimizing and
iterating our results again fully
autonomously. So, that's just one
example. I'm going to run you guys
through a bunch of other use cases that
you can apply auto research to, whether
you're in machine learning engineering
or whether you're just trying to improve
the profitability of, let's say, a
paperclick ad campaign. But first, let's
make sure we all know how to actually
use this thing. So the way that auto
research works to make a long story
short is we start with an experiment and
just like in science everything begins
with some sort of hypothesis. Okay. So
my hypothesis might be hey if I make a
slight adjustment to the copy of this
campaign so that it's a little bit
punchier. I think it's going to go well.
You insert that using this little
test.md. It's your goal metric and some
highle instructions. From there, the
auto research agent will go through
employ the experiment usually using API
calls. In my case, in the example we
just saw um to instantly in Karpathy's
specific example we saw, he's doing it
through adjusting what are called
hyperparameters and then after that we
measure the results. Now, in order for
us to make sure that this works, you
know, the hypothesis isn't enough. We
need some sort of metric that we're
tracking. Now, in my case, the metric
was obviously pretty simple. It was
reply rate. In Karpathy's case, it was
pretty simple. It was something called
validation loss. As long as you have
that, you can then just pick the winner
and then make a slight change before
looping back. And depending on how tight
this feedback loop is, you could
theoretically do this in a minute or
two. I mean, if he had more
infrastructure when he's training his
models, he could probably do in 5
minutes what he does in one. And then in
that way, you know, progress really,
really quickly over to some, you know,
desired goal. In my case, if I had more
cold email infrastructure, I could do
the same thing. So, at this point, scale
is more or less all you need. This
allows you to run hundreds of tests with
literally zero human involvement. I
mean, I'm not even in the loop anymore.
And to be clear, like, if I was in the
loop, would I be making better decisions
than the AI model? Like, probably. I'd
be a much more efficient optimizer, but
that doesn't really matter because the
reality is I take a lot more time to
optimize than a model does. I also eat,
sleep, have to go to the washroom, and
do a variety of other things with my
day. AI agents don't. you could very
quickly and easily set this up on again
an hourly loop and have this run 24
times a day whereas realistically if you
were to try and do it all yourself you
could only do it a couple times and so
in that way whatever metric that you're
tracking goes up over time right in my
case reply rates significantly go up you
know test one I might be at a 1.5% test
12 I might be at a 2.7% before you know
it I reach literally like the optimal
quality possible for my set of cold
emails and then their audiences and you
can apply this has mentioned to a bunch
of other strategies. So what are those
strategies? The requirement that you
need is anything that has an objective
metric you can track and an API or
application programming interface that
you can send a request to to get. Okay,
so some brief examples of this cold
email copy obviously fantastic. Why?
Well, because in our case we have the
instantly API. The Instantly API allows
us to query metrics and so I can give
the agent the ability to call a quick
tool, call up the Instantly API, see how
the performance was relative to um, you
know, the the challenger in the base
campaign. At the same time, you know, I
have a very clear metric, which in my
case is reply rate. Okay, how about
landing pages? Let's say you're doing
some form of CRO, which is conversion
rate optimization, and you want to test
to see how you can make your landing
page as efficient as humanly possible.
Well, you can now completely automate it
with auto research. What you do is you
pick the metric that you want, which in
our case would literally just be
conversion rate. Okay? And then if your
website is hosted locally or it's hosted
using some API or something like that,
let's say a website builder like Wix or
or or or WordPress or Web Flow, what you
can do is you could give it access to
the API and then you could say, "Hey,
change this according to this resource
of best practices that other agents have
done. Make your change. test that for I
don't know a day depending on how much
volume you have and at the end
consolidate the winner and then get rid
of the loser. You can do the exact same
thing for ad creatives. Okay, what's the
main thing that you want for ad
creatives? Obviously, it's going to be
some form of conversion rate as well.
Whatever specific type of conversion
rate is, that's up to you. Okay, but all
you need to do is query some sort of
API. Now, you know, a lot of these ad
platforms like Facebook and Google
basically already do this for you.
minded grant you granted I don't think
they do it anywhere near as effectively
as you can with modern models like Opus
4.6 or GPT 5.4 for what you can do is
you could give it the API to call a
specific ad resource and then you could
also just give it the metric to optimize
for which is CVR and then it'll crush.
How about some form of customer
satisfaction for chatbot scripts? Maybe
use some sort of customer satisfaction
score and then you know now you just
adjust the main template, okay, that all
customer service agents, whether human
or AI are are going off of. That's super
simple and easy to do. How about product
descriptions for some sort of ecom if
you have like, I don't know, Amazon FBA
or something like that? you know, maybe
they don't necessarily have APIs, but
maybe now you set up um what's called
Chrome DevTools MCP, give it a very
tightly scoped list of steps it has to
do to update the actual body of the
landing page, and then based off of
metrics like uh I don't know, how many
freaking dollars you've sold in the last
little while, you can very quickly
optimize and make your product landing
page better and better and better. You
know, in my case, I make a lot of
YouTube content these days. I could do
this automatically with YouTube titles
and the YouTube data analytics v3 API.
You know, you could optimize subject
lines for your newsletters in the same
way. You could optimize pricing pages
the same way. You could optimize
literally whatever you want. And so
hopefully it's clear that at least for,
you know, uh most sales and marketing
purposes, and we're not even going into
the back end here, Auto Research allows
you to build a consolidated set of
knowledge on what works, what doesn't,
and then have that running in the
background for you 24/7 with no human
involvement. But how the heck does this
actually work? Well, three simple steps.
The first is we're going to clone the
repo. I'll show you how to do that in a
moment. We're then going to write some
sort of test. Okay? And you can call it
tests that I'm you can call it whatever
you want. But this only needs to include
a goal, a metric, and a test method. And
then you just give the agent the ability
to run this on autopilot. In my case,
I'm using a service called GitHub
actions, which allows me to store this
in the cloud and then run this on
regular intervals like 4 hours. You can
use GitHub actions, you could use modal,
you could use a billion other providers,
and I'll show you how to do all of that
right now. So the first thing you need
to do is you just need to get the auto
research repo. Now I have a link. it's
the uh top one or top two in the
description. So, click on that. You'll
head over to this page. This will
include all the information including
the Python training scripts, the project
description, a bunch of other scripts,
and then what he's calling program.md
where you provide the model everything
that it needs in order to manage this
whole research process. So, you see in
his case, he says this is an experiment
where you're going to do your own
research, work with the user to agree on
this, create this, read that, verify
this exists, and so on and so forth. And
I want you to know this stuff is not
super important. He's actually
explicitly said that his prompt is
probably pretty crappy and that it'd be
very easy to make a better one. So with
all that in mind, now we need to go over
to our agent. Next, head over to an
integrated development environment or
some sort of tool that allows you to run
clawed code. In my case, I'm using
what's called anti-gravity. You guys
could use Visual Studio Code. You guys
could use like a 100 different apps to
be honest. Um, by the way, if this seems
like magic to you, you don't know what
any of the buttons on the page are. I
literally run through all of it in an
extensive 4-hour cloud code course that
even teaches you like what the different
icons are and so on and so forth. Really
holds your hand through it. So just head
to the top uh right hand corner of the
video for that. Anyway, assuming you
have all this stuff open, we're going to
want to create a new folder. So I'm
going to go here to open folder and then
I'm going to go new. I'm going to say
Carpathy auto research demo. And then
I'll click create. Then I'm going to
open this folder. Okay. Okay. And now in
order to open up cla code, I'm just
going to double click anywhere in here,
click on my little claude code button,
and then what I want to do is I
basically want to clone this. So I'll
say, hey, clone this in the current
working directory.
What this is going to do is it's going
to make an HTTP request over to GitHub,
and then clone this service, store that
down below in a folder called auto
research. And the reason why we're doing
this is because we just want all of the
context of this whole repo before we go
ahead and actually define, you know,
what it is that we're going to do on
this. And so what I want to do just for
demonstration sake is I'm just going to
reproduce my cold email example. After
that, I'm going to give myself a little
bit of space. And now, because I have
access to a voice dictation tool called
Whisper Flow down over here, I'm just
going to hold my Fn key and then tell it
what I want. Hey, I want you to use the
context in the auto research folder to
help me build a very similar idea,
except instead of testing for validation
loss and iterating on a machine learning
model. I want you to do all of this, but
for cold email. The metric I'm
interested in optimizing for is my reply
rate. The platform I'm going to be doing
all this stuff on is instantly, and I'll
give you the API credentials and
everything that you need in a moment.
And finally, the thing that you're going
to change between one experiment and the
other is going to be the copy of the
cold emails. Finally, I want you to take
all this and then put this on the cloud
using GitHub actions. So, it runs once
every hour and it has everything it
needs to work on autopilot. Once I've
pasted that in, I'll press enter. Now,
it's going to go through all of the auto
research documentation. You know, it has
a few things here that's probably not
super important, like this image, which
shows uh I don't know, the progress on
Carpathy's side. You can see here his
baseline was validation BPB. It's some
form of basically accuracy how good the
model is. Started up here and then after
just a few runs it got all the way down
over here by adjusting various
parameters. This is more or less
everything that's going to occur except
with our cold email. So it'll be like um
you know invert this graph reply rate
will start here and then the idea is the
reply rate will go up over time. Anyway,
I'm going to let it run for however long
it needs to before it does everything
that it has to. And then at the end of
it, we're going to have a fully
functional autoresearch campaign. It's
now asking me some questions. How should
the system generate new email copy
variants? So, I'll say Claude, do you
already have campaigns running and
instantly or will this create everything
from scratch? So, I'm going to say from
scratch. Then click submit answers. And
it's now going through and building the
email optimizer. For simplicity, I'm
naming it similar to the other one just
so you guys could see what's going on.
Now it's actually building an instantly
client which will contain all of the API
calls that it needs to make to instantly
to get the information. We also have the
orchestrator. Now orchestrator just for
anybody that doesn't uh isn't inherently
familiar with the language is basically
almost always going to be like your top
top level agent. And the idea is it's
the orchestrator which orchestrates okay
kind of like a conductor in a symphony
or something the function of a bunch of
lower level agents or tools. And so in
this case, what this orchestrator is
doing, I'm going to try and draw a
little blue cloud code logo. Didn't do a
very good job there. But basically
what's occurring is this is
orchestrating any sub aents that we'll
need for maybe the purposes of writing
copy. Um it'll orchestrate the calling
of like the instantly API. It'll
orchestrate the I don't know storing of
documents and uh I don't know JSON
results and obviously you could build in
a database. You could do whatever the
heck you want there. And so this is what
is essentially going to be us just
speaking to the orchestrator saying,
"Hey man, here's what you are. You're an
email optimizer orchestrator and you
have access to all this stuff. Next, the
utility scripts are just little one-off
API calls like tools that allow it to do
things like purge old leads, deploy and
batch, test my parsers, and so on. the
config files here like baseline resource
and in this case I fed it some
additional documentation from a big
course I did inside of Maker School that
teaches people how to write good quality
cold emails. This is just things that I
have the ability to change. So I can
change my baseline test. That's the
first test the cold email optimizer will
ever test against. I could change what's
in resources, although obviously that's
going to be added to. And then I also
have little tokens over here so it can
access the um APIs. And then finally,
the GitHub actions workflow. All right.
And I'm scrolling through here. It's
doing the vast majority of the work,
which is pretty nice. And in in this
case, it's actually creating some sub
agents to do it for me. And if I open
this up, you can see we actually have a
bunch of data. So this is av.example.
So um I'm going to ask it to basically
set this up as a demo, meaning you guys
can just pump in whatever the heck you
want. And then also I'm going to add a
Slack web hook. The reason why I'm doing
that is because I basically just want it
to be able to tell me how it's doing
whenever it makes the changes. Now that
it's doing some testing, we can
basically go ahead. So just for
demonstration purposes, I'll say great
create a baseline and a challenger and
show me dry run. This is a demo. You can
see what it's written over here as well.
The way it works is it runs every hour
via GitHub actions cron. That's just a
scheduling tool that triggers once per
hour. There's three steps. It's going to
harvest by collecting results from the
previous experiment. It'll generate by
creating a new challenger and then it'll
deploy by creating the campaigns,
drawing the leads from a pre-existing
pool or database that I've given it and
then finally activating everything. So
you see the leads are over here. We have
uh the usage then obviously we have like
the big fat long script as well. I
didn't have to write any of it. And this
all follows very similar logic to what
Carpathy was doing. It's just instead of
doing this for like machine learning
purposes, we're obviously doing this for
financial purposes, better reply rates.
Now, because so much of this stuff
occurs completely autonomously, I would
recommend you always have a way to
visualize or at least keep track of
things as they go. And so what I've done
is I've set up a little Slack ping via
web hook that notifies me every time a
new challenger or a baseline variant
test is created. And so what happened is
the other day we actually tested three
different ones. You can see some of
these tests were pretty small and pretty
minor. We just made adjustments to the
subject line and so on and so forth. But
it stores things like the baseline and
the challenger. And then whenever a
harvest occurs, it tells us more or less
which one won. Okay. And we now have the
baseline which is a subject of quick
question. Gives me a bunch of uh
baseline copy here. So I actually wrote
this initial first email. And then it's
generating the challenger. The
hypothesis is the baseline is too long.
It buries the offer and it also lacks a
specific CTA time. So it's going to try
rewriting it to sub 75 words leading
with relevance frontloading the risk
reversal and ending with a concrete time
ask. You'd see it's quite the
significant change here. Hey, first
name. My drive PPC leads for a 2 mill a
year dental marketing firm in Calgary.
I've sold over 10 million business
agencies like yours through cold outdown
alone. Got a backlog of people wanting
PPC right now variety of verticals. I'd
send you booked appointments and only
charge if we hit a number you and I
agree on beforehand. Zero risk on your
end. Is this worth a quick call? It even
then gives a specific time. So I mean it
remains to be seen whether the
challenger is going to be better than
the the baseline, of course, but that's
just part of the game. And you can see
this has now actually been deployed. We
have uh that same copy over here. And
then if we go over to our baseline, we
also have the baseline copy over here,
which is that old cold email. And
basically what's going to occur now is
they're just going to test against each
other until we figure out which one is
better. Now on net, because this is an
AI model we're working with, in my
experience, most challengers are not up
to the task of the baseline. Usually the
baseline is better because I wrote it,
but eventually the challengers do become
better and you start seeing significant
improvements in the reply rate relative
to the original. um which then you know
makes them higher and higher and higher
and higher over time. Then the
challenger becomes the new baseline and
then you just repeat. And so basically
what this is to be honest is like the
automation of like scientific
experiments. Um you know this is
something where right now there's just
so much logistical overhead and friction
involved in like running any sort of
experiment whether you're a marketer, a
salesperson, somebody doing some backend
functionary business or whatever. And
this just eliminates all that friction.
I no longer have to like copy and paste
the leads. I no longer have to like do
anything manually. Um, it's all done via
simple API calls. And now that we can
put this thing on a loop, even though
every time I run the orchestrator, it's
technically like a different agent. It
has all the context from all of the
previous runs, which allows it to grow
more intelligent over time. I anticipate
that eventually after something like 500
to maybe a,000 runs. You'll probably
have to consolidate some of the previous
learnings so that that document doesn't
get super long. But whatever you're
using this for, whether landing pages,
PPC, uh newsletter copy, whatever the
heck, you know, SEO pages, hopefully you
guys understand that as things get
better, the new challengers are just
going to be millions upon millions of
times more profitable and e efficacious
than um what your initial baseline was.
Now, I should note there's some other
things that you have to do in order to
set this up completely. Like for
instance, I actually had to go grab my
API keys. The way you do this on
Instantly is pretty straightforward.
Settings, then you go integrations, then
you go API keys down here. Then you
create an API key, say whatever the heck
you want, select scopes all, and then
actually copy it over. Um, you obviously
need to do that as well with whatever AI
model you're using to do the
orchestration. In my case, I was using
Claude Opus 4.6, so I just went over to
anthropic, got their API key. Um, and
then, you know, if you have any other
other services you want to use like
GitHub, for instance, or whatever, you
also have to push that up. But agents
will handle all that stuff for you. Just
ask them, hey, you know, where do I go
to get my API key? Okay, can you sign me
in? And so on and so forth, and you'll
be good to go. The final thing I want to
talk about are use cases that I would
consider not ideal for some form of auto
optimization. Um, in general, things
that work really well are things that
have fast feedback loops. Okay, so why
did Carpathy's um AI agent or like nano
GPT loop work so well? Because it was
literally a fiveinut loop. You know, if
you have a five-minute loop, technically
speaking, that means that in 60 minutes
you could run 12 experiments. And so
obviously 12 experiments is a lot of
data. And assuming that you know you're
running it on your own servers or
whatever, you can just have that thing
churn. But basically that means that
your your iteration loop will be much
faster because you'll be able to kind of
draw it like this as opposed to like
this. You know, it's going to take a lot
longer to figure out what works and what
doesn't. If you're all the way down
here, another good thing to keep in mind
is you need a clear metric. So in my
case, reply rate was a fantastic metric.
Why? That's objective. How many people
actually replied to my email campaigns?
Click-through rate. It's very very
objective because you know obviously
this is people clicking through an email
all the stuff is automatically tracked
but if you had something that was way
fuzzier in addition to way slower you
know the probability of you actually
making this work uh is is much lower
because how do you subjectively measure
like warmth you know you can't it's like
happiness it's like you can't what you
have to do is you have to find proxies
for all these things which are usually
like scales and metrics and analytics
and so on and so forth and then the
third thing is you need some sort of API
I access to change the inputs. Um, and
if you don't have the API access, you
could build some sort of Chrome dev
tools or CLI based flow, but like you
need to have that because if you don't,
how the heck is the agent supposed to
make any changes? What are they going to
do? Just give you a list of changes to
manually go in. You can do that, but
that sort of defeats the whole purpose.
Anyway, so what I'm going to do with
this is I'm going to provide everything
that you guys need, including the email
optimizer repo, uh, the Carpathy, um,
auto research, GitHub repo, and
everything else down below. Feel free to
take a look at it, give it a click,
explore it, and use it for your own use
case. I'd be really interested to hear
what you guys end up using this on. Um,
this is what all major labs that are
working on machine learning models
around the world are currently doing, by
the way, in case it wasn't clear.
They're constantly running many, many,
many experiments behind the scenes
overnight to like make their models
better and so on and so forth. So, the
fact that we're able to democratize that
and now do that for ourselves, for our
own businesses, and for our own uh own
models is now like incredible. But I'd
be really curious to hear what sort of
use cases you guys have with this. And
you know, if it makes sense, I could
compile a list of these use cases and
then I could make another follow-up
video that just goes through every
single one and then even gives like real
examples of them. Um, because that'd be
really dope. Aside from that, if you
guys do me a big solid, something like
73% of you are not subscribed to the
channel, which really hurts cuz I try
and make high-quality content for both
subscribers and non-subscribers. But
YouTube pushes my content way more
heavily when that ratio improves. So, if
I give you any value today whatsoever,
please do click the subscribe button. I
hate asking for it, but it just makes a
difference on YouTube, so I'll do what
works. If you guys want more on cloud
code and so on and so forth, definitely
check that out. And yeah, I mean, I will
catch all y'all in the next video.
Thanks so much for watching, as per
usual. See you.
