# AI Vendor Evaluation Criteria

Comprehensive framework for systematically evaluating AI vendors across all critical dimensions.

---

## How to Use This Framework

**Scoring system**: Rate each criterion on a 1-5 scale
- **5 = Excellent**: Exceeds expectations, clear competitive advantage
- **4 = Good**: Meets expectations, no concerns
- **3 = Acceptable**: Adequate, minor concerns
- **2 = Concerning**: Significant gaps or risks
- **1 = Unacceptable**: Dis

qualifying issues

**Weighting**: Adjust weights based on your priorities (default weights provided)

**Threshold**: Generally, vendors scoring below 3.5 overall warrant serious concern

- **4.0-4.4**: Good vendor, proceed with confidence
- **3.5-3.9**: Acceptable vendor, manageable risks
- **3.0-3.4**: Concerning, significant risks to address
- **<3.0**: Not recommended, too many red flags

### Decision Matrix

| Overall Score | Individual Category Score <2 | Recommendation |
|---------------|------------------------------|----------------|
| ≥4.0 | No | Proceed |
| ≥4.0 | Yes | Proceed with mitigation plan for weak area |
| 3.5-3.9 | No | Proceed cautiously, detailed risk assessment |

## Using This Framework

**Step 1**: Review evaluation criteria and adjust weights for your situation  
**Step 2**: Conduct vendor interviews and demos focused on evaluation criteria  
**Step 3**: Score each vendor using the scorecard template  
**Step 4**: Review scores and identify any disqualifying issues (any category <2)  
**Step 5**: Compare vendor scores and make selection based on overall fit

**Remember**: Scores are a framework for structured decision-making, not a replacement for judgment. Use scores to identify risks and inform discussion, not as the sole decision factor.
